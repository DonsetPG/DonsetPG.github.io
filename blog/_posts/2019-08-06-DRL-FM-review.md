title: A review on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Fluid Mechanics
---

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently been adopted in a wide range of
physics and engineering domains for its ability to solve decision-making
problems that were previously out of reach due to a combination of
non-linearity and high dimensionality. In the last few years, it has
spread in the field of computational mechanics, and particularly in fluid
dynamics, with recent applications in flow control and shape optimization.
In this work, we conduct a detailed review of existing DRL applications to fluid
mechanics problems. In addition, we present recent results that
further illustrate the potential of DRL in Fluid Mechanics. The coupling
methods used in each case are covered, detailing their pros and cons. Our review also focuses
on the comparison with classical methods for optimal control
and optimization. Finally, several test cases are described that illustrate
recent progress made in this field. The goal of this publication is
to provide an understanding of DRL capabilities along with state-of-the-art
applications in fluid dynamics to researchers wishing to address new
problems with these methods.
