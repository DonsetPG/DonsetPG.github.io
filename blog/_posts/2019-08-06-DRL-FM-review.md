title: A review on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Fluid Mechanics
---

When I started an Internship at the [CEMEF](http://www.cemef.mines-paristech.fr), I've already worked with both Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Fluid Mechanics, but never used one with the other. I knew that several people already went down that lane (cf refs), some where even currently working at the [CEMEF](http://www.cemef.mines-paristech.fr) when I arrived. However, I (and my tutor Elie) still had several questions/goals on my mind :

* How was DRL applied to Fluid Mechanics?
* To improve in both subject, I wanted to try a test case on my own;
* How could we code something as general as possible?

The results of these questions are available [here](arxiv link), with the help of a fantastic team.

# Applications of DRL to Fluid mechanics :

Several Fluid Mechanics problems have already been tackled with the help of DRL. They always (mostly) follow the same pattern, using DRL tools on one side (such as [Gym](a), [Tensorforce](a) or [stables-baselines](a), etc) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on the other ([Fenics](a), [Openfoam](a), etc).
