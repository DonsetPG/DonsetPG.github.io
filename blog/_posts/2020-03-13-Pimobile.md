When we started talking about this project with [Matthias]([add linkedin link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthias-cremieux-4b1222153/)), we knew that both building a Lego motorized car, and learning to drive with real life Deep Reinforcement Learning was [possible](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00412.pdf). However, we wanted to do both at the same time. We recently acquired a Raspberry Pi 4b and knew that the power limitations set by the previous model vanished. However, we didn't know exactly how to fit everything into a lego car, and how to train it properly. We came up with 2 cars, and 2 methods of learning :

* a first model (that looks terrible), driving with a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent
* a much better car, driving with an Imitation Learning algorithm

The first one drove on an inside track built in my home, while the second drove outside.

# PI-Mobile V1 

## Assembling the car

The first step of building an lego car is building its structure and deciding the location of each component on the car in order to make it as compact as possible. Considering that we did not look at any car blueprint or tutorial to build it, it was almost like reinventing the car in a way, and consequently, the car we built is clearly not the prettiest of all time! However, it does drive although it is not that fast nor that smooth. 

### The stucture

We decided to choose a 3-engines solution : two at the back of the car that would power each wheel separately, and one at the front, that would be powering the steering system that we would've built.

</p>

We chose to separate the car electronic system in two halves : one half would be the core of the car and would be linked to the motors, power them, and would take care of the DRL part of the project, and the second half would be here to cool the first part, as all the operations listed above are really energy-consuming. 

The core part consists of a raspberry Pi 4b (we chose this device to be the center of all the operations because of its huge specifications compared to the rasberry pi 3) and a card from dexter industries that manages the like with the lego technics. Whereas the secondary part consists of a battery powering a raspberry pi 3 that powers a small fan, installed inbetween the two cards of the car's core. While using a rp3 to power a fan seems a bit of an overkill, it also allows us a convenient flexibility in programming, were we to decide to use a Master/slave architecture to compute the DRL part if the RP4 capped its power due to overheat. 

We then used a raspbian image, unaltered, with the convenient package Vncviewer, that allows us to access the raspbian of the pi via ssh protocol. From there, we can launch our script to make the car move.

We also used a raspberry camera on top of the car. This camera was the only input our car would use to drive around. 

### The track 

The PI-Mobile V1 trained on a track we built inside my house. It is made of paper and is of 8 meters long. However, it has a bridge in the middle, a bridge the car could never learn to pass properly (because it struggles going only forward because of bad conception...). Because of this, we splitted the track into 2 parts: a training part and a testing part :

## The learning algorithm : DQL

</p>

We used a Deep Q-learning agent to train our car to drive, with some mineurs modifications: human control. Since the agent is not interacting with a simulation but with the real wolrd, we are the one telling it when to stop, or when it's good or bad. We setted up several keys: one to pause the current episode, one to finish it when the car is doing something bad, and finally one to end the episode when the car reaches the end of the track. The algorithm is available below :

Regarding the reward, we used a simple function: 1 at every step, except when the car fails (-1) or when it reaches the end of the trach (time spent on the track). The goal being to drive properly, and as fast as it could. 

```java
public double reward(String key, double time_since_start) {
    double reward = 0;
    
    if (key == stop) {
        reward = -1;
    } else if (key == end) {
        reward = (10. - time_since_start)/100.;
    } else {
        reward = 1;
    }
    
    return reward;
}
```

Overall, our car learned to drive on the testing track in less than 50 episodes (arround an hour and a half). We tracked the distance made autonomously on the testing track every 5 training episodes :
