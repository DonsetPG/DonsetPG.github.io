<b> <a href="https://donsetpg.github.io/blog/2020/03/13/Pimobile/"> Football Data Analysis - Liverpool FC attacking system</a> </b>
<p>
This post illustrates how data analysis and machine learning can be applied to football playersâ€™ tracking data in order to reveal key insights. Our analysis will be articulated in two parts :
Pitch control for opponent analysis & Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for accessing action value.

One Raspberry Pi, some Lego and a bunch of Deep Learning? Challenge accepted.

<b> <a href="https://donsetpg.github.io/blog/2019/08/06/DRL-FM-review/"> Deep Reinforcement Learning and Fluid Mechanics?</a> </b>
<p>
  When I started an Internship at the CEMEF, I've already worked with both Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Fluid Mechanics, but never used one with the other. I knew that several people already went down that lane, some where even currently working at the CEMEF when I arrived. However, I (and my tutor Elie) still had several questions/goals on my mind :
  <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>How was DRL applied to Fluid Mechanics?</li>
    <li>To improve in both subject, I wanted to try a test case on my own;</li>
    <li>How could we code something as general as possible?</li>
  </ul>

<b> <a href="https://donsetpg.github.io/blog/2018/09/02/LOCAM/"> Legends of Code & Magic - a Codingame contest</a> </b>
<p>
  Create AI for games? Ok why not. For an Hearthstone-like game? Sounds ok. Look at your AI playing against others? Now this sounds like a plan. This contest was host by Codingame in Aug. 2018., and I had to use several exciting concepts to (or try to at least) solve it: Genetic algorithms, MC and MCTS, etc.
