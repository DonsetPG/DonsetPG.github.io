<b> <a href="https://donsetpg.github.io/blog/2019/08/06/DRL-FM-review/"> Deep Reinforcement Learning and Fluid Mechanics?</a> </b>
<p>
  When I started an Internship at the CEMEF, I've already worked with both Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Fluid Mechanics, but never used one with the other. I knew that several people already went down that lane, some where even currently working at the CEMEF when I arrived. However, I (and my tutor Elie) still had several questions/goals on my mind :
  <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>How was DRL applied to Fluid Mechanics?</li>
    <li>To improve in both subject, I wanted to try a test case on my own;</li>
    <li>How could we code something as general as possible?</li>
  </ul>
</p>
