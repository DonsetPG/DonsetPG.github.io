<b> <a href="https://donsetpg.github.io/blog/2020/12/24/Narya/"> Narya: track soccer players and evaluate them </a> </b>
<p>
This blog post is the markdown version of a list of Jupyter Notebooks you can find inside <a href="https://github.com/DonsetPG/narya"> Narya's repository</a>. This post allows to have each Notebook at the same place. It will probably be replaced by a Jupyter Book whenever I find the time and the solution to integrate them into this blog.

<b> <a href="https://donsetpg.github.io/blog/2020/08/30/unsupervised-nlp-ltr/"> Semi-Supervised Learning for Bilingual Lexicon Induction</a> </b>
<p>
This blog post contains an introduction to Unsupervised Bilingual Alignment and Multilingual Alignment. We also go through the theoretical framework behind Learning to Rank, and discuss how it migh help to produce better alignments in a Semi-Supervised fashion.

<b> <a href="https://donsetpg.github.io/blog/2020/05/10/LiverpoolData/"> Football Data Analysis - Liverpool FC attacking system</a> </b>
<p>
This post illustrates how data analysis and machine learning can be applied to football playersâ€™ tracking data in order to reveal key insights. Our analysis will be articulated in two parts :
Pitch control for opponent analysis & Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for accessing action value.

<b> <a href="https://donsetpg.github.io/blog/2019/08/06/DRL-FM-review/"> Deep Reinforcement Learning and Fluid Mechanics?</a> </b>
<p>
  When I started an Internship at the CEMEF, I've already worked with both Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Fluid Mechanics, but never used one with the other. I knew that several people already went down that lane, some where even currently working at the CEMEF when I arrived. However, I (and my tutor Elie) still had several questions/goals on my mind :
  <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>How was DRL applied to Fluid Mechanics?</li>
    <li>To improve in both subject, I wanted to try a test case on my own;</li>
    <li>How could we code something as general as possible?</li>
  </ul>

<b> <a href="https://donsetpg.github.io/blog/2018/09/02/LOCAM/"> Legends of Code & Magic - a Codingame contest</a> </b>
<p>
  Create AI for games? Ok why not. For an Hearthstone-like game? Sounds ok. Look at your AI playing against others? Now this sounds like a plan. This contest was host by Codingame in Aug. 2018., and I had to use several exciting concepts to (or try to at least) solve it: Genetic algorithms, MC and MCTS, etc.
